            <p>Ahlan (hello!) üëãüèΩ</p>
            <p>
                I recently completed my graduate work at the MIT Media Lab where I developed <a href= "https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/introducing-a-new-class-of-creative-tools-for-educators-creative-learning-design-tools/" target="_blank">creative design tools for educators</a>, 
                explored future models for learning, and experimented with ways to
                 <a href= "https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/designing-digital-workspaces-for-creativity-and-collaboration-in-online-project-based-courses/" target="_blank">bring project-based learning online</a> in response to COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                While at MIT, I also contributed to Scratch (a programming language and community used by 200M people in 2019), 
                developed a tool to support school leaders in iterative and inclusive planning, 
                and strategized with partners ranging from governments (e.g. South Africa's Ministry of Education) to 
                innovative schools. 
            </p>

                Before MIT, I helped launch a <a href="https://www.alueducation.com/" target="_blank">pan-African University network</a> with sites in Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa, and Kenya. 
                We remixed ideas from Minerva, Ashesi, High Tech High, 42, and many others as we tried to create a new kind of university: 
                hands on projects, research, and internships replaced lectures and problem sets. 
                I built and scaled our faculty team, managed accreditation partnerships, 
                and negotiated our ambitious vision with the challenges of launching a university from the ground-up.
