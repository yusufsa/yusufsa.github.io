<!-- Hello! Welcome to my site. I've been thinking about the indie web lately. About a world where more people
feel comfortable building basic sites and sharing their ideas and experiences with the world. 

This site is an experiment related to some of those ideas. Inspired by friends making simple sites.

Poke around, feel free to remix this, or get in touch if you have ideas or want to talk :)

PS if you're new to web dev and want to make a simple home page, you can start with something like this (html and css)
or you can try using a tool like Notion or Coda.
Feel free to remix this bio I made on Coda: https://coda.io/@yusufa/meet-yusuf -->
