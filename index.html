            <p>Ahlan (hello!) üëãüèΩ</p>
          
            <p>
                I recently completed my graduate work at the MIT Media Lab where I developed <a href= "https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/introducing-a-new-class-of-creative-tools-for-educators-creative-learning-design-tools/" target="_blank">creative design tools for educators</a>, 
                explored future models for school, and brought
                 <a href= "https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/designing-digital-workspaces-for-creativity-and-collaboration-in-online-project-based-courses/" target="_blank">robotics and product design courses online</a> in response to COVID-19.

                Before MIT, I helped launch a <a href="https://www.alueducation.com/" target="_blank">pan-African University network</a>.
                We remixed ideas from Minerva, Ashesi, High Tech High, 42, and many others as we tried to create a new kind of university: 
                hands on projects, research, and internships replaced lectures and problem sets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I led a faculty team of 20+ in launching four degree programs, managed accreditation partnerships, 
                and negotiated our ambitious vision with the challenges of launching a university from the ground-up. 
                We <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1515015/african-leadership-university-raises-30-million-series-b/" target="_blank">raised over $80M USD</a> from investors including the Omidyar Network, Bob King, 
                and Anders Povlsen.
