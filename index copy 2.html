<!-- Hello! Welcome to my site. I've been thinking about the indie web lately. About a world where more people
felt comfortable building basic sites and sharing parts of themselves with the world. 

This site is an experiment related to some of those ideas. Inspired by friends making super simple sites.

Poke around, feel free to remix this, or get in touch if you have ideas or want to talk :) -->

            <!-- About Me -->
            <p>Ahlan (hello!) 👋🏽</p>
          
            <p>
                We live in a world where many people don’t see themselves as creators. 
                I seek to change that by building better tools and communities to make and think with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently completed my graduate work at MIT where I contributed to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, 
                developed <a href= "https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/introducing-a-new-class-of-creative-tools-for-educators-creative-learning-design-tools/" target="_blank">creative tools for educators</a>, 
                and advised ambitious education initiatives. 
                I also co-taught a class on creative learning technologies with Mitchel Resnick.

                Before MIT, I led development (from ideation to scale-up) of degree programs at a <a href="https://www.alueducation.com/" target="_blank">pan-African University</a> 
                with campuses in Mauritius, Rwanda, and Kenya and over $80M USD in funding. 
                We remixed ideas from places like Olin, Minerva, 42, Ashesi, and High Tech High to create a new kind of university: 
                students learn through projects, research, and industry placements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I mentor youth at a community makerspace and coach MIT startups.
