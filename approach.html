            <!-- About Me -->
            <p>My work builds on ideas from a number of fields, with strong roots in 
                human computer interaction, human-centered design, history of science, 
                and the learning sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many non-Western traditions, knowledge is often described in terms of 
                linneage: I learned from X who learned from Y. My work draws on a few lineages: 
            </p>
            <h2>Constructionism</h2>
            <p>
                I'm most influenced by my mentors 
                Mitchel Resnick (inventor of Scratch and LEGO Robotics) and Bakhtiar Mikhak, both of whom build on ideas from
                Seymour Papert. Papert escaped apartheid South Africa to work with Jean Piaget 
                and later joined MIT where he collaborated closely with Marvin Minsky in founding
                the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the MIT Media Lab. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Papert introduced a set of powerful ideas for thinking about learning known as 
                <i>Constructionism</i>: people learn by constructing ideas in their minds (constructivism),
                 a process that is especially impactful when they construct ideas through 
                 external artifacts. His work intsercts with ideas from Maria Montessori, 
                 Loris Mallaguzi (Reggio Emilia), and Eleanor Duckworth (known for her legendary 
                 work supporting children in discovering wonderful ideas). 
            </p>
            <h2>Deeper Learning</h2>
            <p>
                I'm also influenced by work from 
                High Tech High, Transcend, and the Deeper Learning Network -- and in 
                turn from mentors including Rob Riordan, Jal Mehta, and Sarah Fine. 
            </p>
            <h2>Human Computer Interaction</h2>
            <p>This is a super broad field, one that I was introduced to recently at MIT.
                I'm particularly inspired by people like older hands like Alan Kay or Doug Engelbert
                and more recent efforts by folks at Ink and Switch, Dynamicland, HARC, 
                the Software Design Group, and my chums at the Media Lab. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also recently discovered folks working on <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/#questioning-premises">'tools for thought'</a>. 
                People like Andy Matuschak or Roam Research. 
            </p>
            <h2>Reggio and Montessori</h2>
            <p>
                People often point to IB (International Baccalaureate) as one of the few post-industrial school models that has reached significant scale. 
                However, I find more inspiration in Reggio Emilia and Montessori traditions. They differ in important ways, but are alike in that
                they offer compelling alternatives to industrial school. 
            </p>
            <h2>Tensions</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Honest, precise conversation:</strong> Too often, discussions 
                about education are cast in superficial, binary terms: 
                charter or public schools, content or skills, citizenship or employment. While 
                these tensions can be real, they often obscure deeper, causal factors 
                ranging from resource allocation to the theories of knowledge, learning, and teaching 
                that often underlie different models for school. For example, a project-based learning experience at 
                High Tech High differs dramatically from a project-based experience at KIPP. However, we rarely 
                have honest and direct conversations about the differences in these approaches.
